# Directory-Structure
## The codes and their functions I have used

1- **mkdir**: Creates a new file.<br/>
2- **pwd**: It shows which file location we are in.<br/>
3- **cd**: It allows us to go inside the file we want.<br/>
4- **ls**: It is used to list the contents of the file we are in.<br/>
5- **touch**: It allows us to open the desired file type to the folder we are in. (.txt, .doc, etc.)<br/>
6- **echo**: Allows us to write text in the file type we are activating. Even if we didn't create the file type
even automatically creates that file type first and then writes what we want it to write in.
